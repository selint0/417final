                <p>These plants all vary in care level and can either be a great addition to your space or a project for you to challenge yourself with! We like to view these guys as member of our crew and we hope to see you take one home and promote them to your own. Eventually one plant will turn to two and three, trust us with this new addiction because there is no turning back from here.</p>
